[Sonic Pi](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/sonicpi/) is an open-source programming environment developed by Dr Sam Aaron, designed to explore and teach programming concepts through the process of creating new sounds. This is a scheme of work which emphasises the importance of creativity in the learning process and gives users the control to turn their sonic ideas into reality.

This scheme of work is specifically targeted towards introductory KS3 Computer Science. It has been developed in harmony with the new Computing curriculum in the UK. The scheme of work is the result of a close collaboration between Computing and ICT teachers and researchers at the University of Cambridge. It has been successfully trialled at a number of schools.
